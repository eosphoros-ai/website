## Introduction 
DB-GPT creates a vast model operating system using [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and offers a large language model powered by [Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/Tribbiani/vicuna-7b). In addition, we provide private domain knowledge base question-answering capability. Furthermore, we also provide support for additional plugins, and our design natively supports the Auto-GPT plugin.Our vision is to make it easier and more convenient to build  applications around databases and llm.


Is the architecture of the entire DB-GPT shown in the following figure:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/DB-GPT.png" width="800" />
</p>

The core capabilities mainly consist of the following parts:
1. Knowledge base capability: Supports private domain knowledge base question-answering capability.
2. Large-scale model management capability: Provides a large model operating environment based on FastChat.
3. Unified data vector storage and indexing: Provides a uniform way to store and index various data types.
4. Connection module: Used to connect different modules and data sources to achieve data flow and interaction.
5. Agent and plugins: Provides Agent and plugin mechanisms, allowing users to customize and enhance the system's behavior.
6. Prompt generation and optimization: Automatically generates high-quality prompts and optimizes them to improve system response efficiency.
7. Multi-platform product interface: Supports various client products, such as web, mobile applications, and desktop applications.

### Platform Deployment
- autodl
    [autodl image](https://www.codewithgpu.com/i/csunny/DB-GPT/csunny-db-gpt). You can refer to the image instructions to build from scratch, or use `docker pull` to obtain the shared image, follow the instructions in the document to operate. If you have any questions, please leave a comment.

## Usage Instructions

- [Multi LLMs Usage](https://db-gpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/llms.html)
- [Create your own knowledge repository](https://db-gpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/knowledge.html)

If nltk-related errors occur during the use of the knowledge base, you need to install the nltk toolkit. For more details, please refer to: [nltk documents](https://www.nltk.org/data.html)
Run the Python interpreter and type the commands:

```bash
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
```
