"In order to facilitate the management of knowledge after vectorization, "
"we have built-in multiple vector storage engines, from memory-based "
"Chroma to distributed Milvus. Users can choose different storage engines "
"according to their own scenario needs. The storage of knowledge vectors "
"is the cornerstone of AI capability enhancement. As the intermediate "
"language for interaction between humans and large language models, "
"vectors play a very important role in this project."
